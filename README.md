# Hospital Management System
  
In hospital management systems (HMS), efficient scheduling of appointments across departments like the lab, pharmacy, and doctor's booking is essential for timely patient care. Through integrated software solutions and strategic schedules, hospital facilities aim to optimize resource allocation and minimize patient wait times. By prioritizing urgent cases and ensuring equitable distribution of services, HMS plays a crucial role in enhancing patient satisfaction and operational efficiency within the healthcare setting."
