## Introduction

This project illustrates the design and implementation of a web-based **Hospital Management System** for NEETHI LABS AND SCANS â€“ CHELANNUR. The main objective of the HMS is to efficiently manage hospital details, including doctors, employees, tests, and medicines. The aim is to reduce manual work, enhance efficiency, and track information about the hospital, patients, and medicines.

- **Search Facilities:** Provides searching facilities based on various factors such as hospital, employee, test, and medicine.
- **Detailed Tracking:** Tracks all the details about doctors, employees, patients, tests, etc.
- **Export Functionality:** Allows easy export of data in PDF formats for patients, tests, doctors, employees, and medicines.
- **Medicine Integration:** Integration of all records of medicine.

## Objectives

Streamline administrative processes such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, and billing to reduce manual work and errors. Maintain accurate and up-to-date records of patient information, including personal details, medical history, and treatment plans.

## Main Activities of the System

### Laboratory Information System (LIS)

- **Centralized Database:** Serves as a centralized database for storing and managing laboratory test results, available both online and offline.
- **Sample Tracking:** Enable users to register and track samples throughout the testing process, generating unique identifiers linked to patient information.
- **Patient Information Management:** Store and manage patient demographics, personal details, and medical history. Associate patient information with test requests and results.
- **Test Request Management:** Allow users to create, manage, and specify types of tests to be conducted. Support electronic test ordering by healthcare providers.
- **Result Entry and Reporting:** User-friendly interface for entering test results. Generate standardized reports for easy interpretation. Support electronic result delivery to healthcare providers.
- **Billing and Invoicing:** Integrate billing functionality to manage financial aspects. Generate invoices for tests conducted and services provided.

### Online Doctor Booking and Consultation

- **Online Booking:** Patients can book appointments online through the HMS portal. They can select their preferred doctor, date, and time slot.
- **Offline Booking:** For patients who prefer traditional methods or do not have access to the internet, offline booking can be facilitated. Patients can call or visit the hospital to book appointments.
- **Doctor Booking:** The HMS can facilitate the process of booking appointments with doctors, either online or offline.
- **Consultation Management:** Efficiently manage consultation processes, keeping track of history, prescribed medicines, and follow-up appointments.
- Information about Patients is done by just writing the Patients' name, age, and gender. Whenever the Patient comes up, his information is stored freshly.
- Bills are generated by recording the price for each facility provided to the Patient on a separate sheet and at last, they all are summed up.
- Diagnosis information to patients is generally recorded on the document, which contains Patient information. It is destroyed after some time period to decrease the paper load in the office.
- Information about various diseases is not kept as any document. Doctors themselves do this job by remembering various medicines.
The HMS is an integrated solution that helps manage hospital resources and functions efficiently by integrating multiple hospital departments into one single network. It is constantly evolving to meet new challenges.
